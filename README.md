#  TASK 1: 3D Printing 
**Objective:** To understand the working of 3D printer, from online sources. To learn about the Bed temperature and other priner settings.\
**Outcomes&Learning:**

#### **1.PLA(Poly latic acid):**
 one of the most widely used plastics in the additive manufacturing sector. PLA is often considered to be a more sustainable thermoplastic since it does not come from finite resources, as is the case with petroleum, but is sourced from natural and renewable resources.
#### **2.Bed Temperature:** 
PLA/PLA+ can be printed on an unheated bed, for best results we can maintain the bed temperature 50°C-60°C. 


3.PLA prints best when rapidly cooled with the aid of your extruder's fan. This will ensure a clean, crisp layers with neat details. For the best surface resolution possible, set the extruder fan speed to 100%   
#### **4.Printing Speed:**
For the better results from the 3D printer we should the speed at 55mm/s or lesst to achieve great surface resolution.
#### **5.Post printing procedures:** 
**a.Joining 3D printed parts** \
Cyanoacrylate glue (superglue) or two-stage epoxies are a great choice when joining PLA parts. \
**b.Painting** \
Except Nylon and PETG allmost all 3D printed parts can be painted. \
**c.Sanding** \
PLA parts with progressively finer grades of sandpaper can result in super smooth surface finishes, but sanding process should be done slowly to prevent parts from breaking and melting because of the friction. \
Due to time constraint on the lab i missed to print a model.In  future i defenately print a model.

 **Outcomes&Learning:** 
 #### 1.working of ultrasonic sensor
 ![alt text](https://github.com/Vishalpolicepatil/Report/blob/40d2cf5e8cc5aa286d58397fd0a335987be0743f/working%20of%20ultra%20sonic%20sensor.jpg?raw=true)
 Ultrasonic sensors are electronic devices that calculate the target’s distance by emission of ultrasonic sound waves and convert those waves into electrical signals. The speed of emitted ultrasonic waves traveling speed is faster than the audible sound.\
 To know the distance between the target and the sensor, the sensor calculates the amount of time required for sound emission to travel from transmitter to receiver. The calculation is done as follows: \
       D=T*c/2 \
where, ‘T’ corresponds to time measured in seconds \
       'c' corresponds to speed of sound= 343 m/s \
       **Ultrasonic sensor Working Principle** \
       The working principle of the ultra sonic sensor is same as radar or sonar it produces high frequency of sound and analyze the echoes by sensors.\

learnt about various parts and functions of the L298N Motor driver\
#### **2.Speed Controlling Using an L298N Motor Driver**
The speed of a DC motor can be controlled by changing its input voltage. A widely used technique to accomplish this is Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). PWM is a technique in which the average value of the input voltage is adjusted by sending a series of ON-OFF pulses. This average voltage is proportional to the width of the pulses, which is referred to as the Duty Cycle. The higher the duty cycle, the higher the average voltage applied to the DC motor, resulting in an increase in motor speed. The shorter the duty cycle, the lower the average voltage applied to the DC motor, resulting in a decrease in motor speed.
Note: The pins in L298N driver which are responsible for speed control are ENA & ENB, these pins should be compulsorily connected to the PWM (~) ports of the Arduino UNO, so that PWM takes place. \

- PWM  to control speed: \
The speed of a DC motor can be controlled by changing its input voltage. A common technique to do this is to use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). PWM is a technique where the average value of the input voltage is adjusted by sending a series of ON-OFF pulses. The average voltage is proportional to the width of the pulses known as the Duty Cycle.
- H-Bridge to control the rotation direction: \
The spinning direction of a DC motor can be controlled by changing the polarity of its input voltage. A common technique for doing this is to use an H-bridge. An H-bridge circuit consists of four switches with the motor in the centre forming an H-like arrangement. Closing two specific switches at a time reverses the polarity of the voltage applied to the motor. This causes a change in the spinning direction of the motor.
